title: Community Foundation Network
intro: '<p>The CFN brings together charitable Community Foundations from all over the UK, to strengthen and improve the lives of local communities.</p>'
goal: '<p>CFN needed a user-friendly site which could hold the vast amount of information within an easy-to-digest format and structure. The new site highlights the great achievements of community foundations all over the country and effectively talks to philanthropists.<br></p>'
involvement: '<p>Working with the <a href="http://cogdesign.com/">Cog Design</a> team; I built the site using <a href="http://expressionengine.com">Expression Engine</a>, HTML5, CSS, <a href="http://www.slidesjs.com/">SlidesJS</a> and <a href="http://wayfarerweb.com/jquery/plugins/mapbox/">Mapbox</a>. I also trained CFN members how to update the site and gave support after the launch.<br></p>'
