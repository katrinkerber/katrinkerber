status: live
intro: |
  <p>AWARE&nbsp;is the only veterinary conservation trust in Zimbabwe. It is run by veterinarians and was set up to get much needed funding for projects that look after the&nbsp;welfare of wildlife and wildlife habitats.</p>
  
  <p>This website was my first development gig back in 2009. A fantastic opportunity which I still cherrish and am grateful for.<br>
  </p>
goal: |
  <p>AWARE needed to communicate it's work in Zimbabwe effectively to both veterinarians and the general public. They wanted to display their great in-the-field imagery and move visitors to supporting them by donating, volunteering and funding equipment.<br>
  </p>
involvement: |
  <p>I ran the entire process of setting up the domain, emails, hosting, to designing and building the site. I also set up a <a href="http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> account and template, which is used to keep supporters up-to-date.<br>
