intro: |
  <p>The AWARE Trust website was my first ever development gig back in 2009. Non-profits and animal welfare are close to my heart, so this was a fantastic opportunity which I still cherrish and am very grateful for.<br>
  </p>
goal: |
  <p>AWARE needed to communicate their work in Zimbabwe effectively to both veterinarians and the general public. They wanted to display their great in-the-field imagery and move visitors to supporting them by donating, volunteering and funding equipment.<br>
  </p>
involvement: |
  <p>I run the entire process of setting up the domain, emails, hosting, to designing and building the site. I also set up a <a href="http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> account and template, which is used to keep supporters up-to-date.<br>
