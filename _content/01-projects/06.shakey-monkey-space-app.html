title: Shakey Monkey Space App
status: live
intro: |
  <p>The <a href="http://cogdesign.com">Cog Design</a> team were bored by the trend of very similar, 'style-over-substance' poster designs and album covers which appeared in countless magazines, websites, and student portfolios. So they decided to make an App for designers to create their own artwork with a shake.</p>
  
  <p>It went down well with fellow designers like <a href="http://www.designerdan.co.uk/2011/03/shakey-monkey-space-app-by-cog-design.html">Designer Dan</a> and <a href="http://www.creative-inspiration.co.uk/?p=3615">Creative Inspiration</a>.</p>
  
  <p><small>Unfortunately, the app is no longer available to download.</small></p>
goal: '<p>A fun-poking app that randomly puts together carefully crafted landscape, space, line, shape and animal graphics.</p>'
involvement: '<p>With the help of the powerful <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-sdk">Appcelerator Titanium SDK</a>, I built the app using the languages I know and love best: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br></p>'
