title: Unbiased
intro: '<p>Unbiased is a professional adviser search website with a comprehensive archive and a host of resources, making it easy for users to find the right adviser and tools for their needs.</p>'
goal: |
  <p><a href="http://www.tangentsnowball.com/">Tangent Snowball</a> was hired to completely re-design and re-build the site's front and back-end, making it more attractive and easier to use for users and advisers alike.</p>
involvement: '<p>Tangent asked me to kick off the build by creating a style guide containing the modular components, ranging from buttons, icons to accordions and tabs, and by coding the home page. This&nbsp;was then used as a basis for all other pages and sections by the fellow development team. Later, I also built the front-end of adviser account management section of the site.</p>'
