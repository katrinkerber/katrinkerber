title: Unbiased
intro: '<p>Unbiased is a professional adviser search website with a comprehensive archive and a host of resources, making it easy for users to find the adviser and tools for their needs.</p>'
goal: |
  <p><a href="http://www.tangentsnowball.com/">Tangent Snowball</a> was hired to completely re-design and re-build the site's front and back-end, making it more attractive and easier to use.</p>
involvement: '<p>To kick off the build I set up a style guide with modular components, ranging from buttons, icons to accordions and tabs, and built the home page. ThisÂ was then used as a basis for all other pages and sections by the fellow development team. Later, I also built the front-end of the adviser account management section.</p>'
