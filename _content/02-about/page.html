page_content: |
  <p>I have always enjoyed using computers and the internet. I fondly remember the many evenings spent playing point and click games on floppy disks, listening to the shrieking of a 56k modem, and patiently waiting for website content to load bit by bit by bit...</p>
  
  <p>I had my first peek behind the scenes of making websites whilst working for the great charity&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spana.org">SPANA</a>&nbsp;as a fundraiser. I was hooked straight away and decided that this was what I wanted to do for a living.</p>
  
  <p>So, in 2009, I completed a course at the London College to get to grips with HTML, CSS and some basic PHP.</p>
  
  <p>Since then I have been involved in more than 30 projects and have worked with great organisations, designers and developers.</p>
  
  <p>I try to be conscious about the consequences of my actions and the impact it has on people, other creatures and the environment. I want to do my bit by focussing on working for good causes wherever I can, so have set myself <a href="/ethical-policy/">ethical guidelines</a>, and offer a 10% discount on work for non-profit organisations.</p>
