<p>I am committed to making my actions, both professionally and personally, more ethical, conscious, eco-friendly and kind.</p>

<p>Therefore, I will never knowingly work for individuals or organisations who support or actively encourage harming people, animals or the planet.</p>

<p>Instead I focus my (professional) energy on helping to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reduce environmental pollution </li>
	<li>improve local communities </li>
	<li>promote fair production and trading of goods </li>
	<li>prevent animals to live in fear and pain </li>
</ul>
<p>I offer a 10% discount to all non-profits and any organisations that encourage vegan, eco-friendly or fair-trade practices, and host websites carbon-neutrally through <a href="http://ecohosting.co.uk/">Eco Hosting</a>.</p>
