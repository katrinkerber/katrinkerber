  Whilst recently working on a couple of pretty big sites, I acquainted myself with writing CSS the LESS way.
  Like a good girl, I set up global variables, magical mixins, nested and intended selectors, wrote every declaration on a new line, and broke styles down into seperate files. I worked closely with other developers and it went well.

<p>Oh, forgive me CSS Lords, for I have tried!</p>

<p>Whilst recently working on a couple of pretty big sites (<a href="http://www.easons.com">Easons</a> and <a href="http://unbiased.co.uk">Unbiased</a> - thanks <a href="http://www.tangentsnowball.com/">Team Tangent</a>), I acquainted myself with writing CSS the LESS way.</p>

<p>Like a good girl, I set up global variables, magical mixins, nested and intended selectors, wrote every declaration on a new line, and broke styles down into seperate files. I worked closely with other developers and it went well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Writing CSS is my favourite part of developing sites, but something didn't seem right. I couldn't put my finger on it.</p>

<p>Then, recently, I was asked to make some updates to a site I had built a while ago. I opened the stylesheet and the moment I looked at it my heart skipped a beat. All the declarations were together in one file, nicely ordered into sections. But most importantly selector names were repeated, on single lines, and with minimal indentation. Within an instant I knew exactly what I was looking at, what I needed to do and where to make the amends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was how I used to write CSS, and I didn't realise how much I missed until then.</p>

<p>By that time I had already started to code this site, but I went into an overhaul frenzy and immediately merged my stylesheets and separated nested selectors. As I progressed the build I found my way of making the best of what Sass has to offer (I moved on from LESS). I love variables and mixins, and I like to keep major chunks of fixed component declarations in seperate files - keeping the main stylesheet easily scannable. <a href="/_themes/candy/css/styles.scss">This is what it currently looks like</a>.</p>

<p>I do of course understand the need to code CSS in such a way that it is easy for fellow developers to work with, particularly on big sites, but my heart will always go out to the humble single file, in single line stylesheet.</p>

<p>Look at this beauty, for example:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/notes/single-line-css.png" alt="Screenshot of a CSS file written in single lines" style=""></p>

<p>What's not to love?*</p>

<p><small>* This is a rhetorical question. I am too well aware of the can of worms that is asking developers about preferences for single- and multi-line CSS ;)</small></p>
