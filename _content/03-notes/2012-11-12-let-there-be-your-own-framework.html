<p>The number of front-end frameworks or boilerplates available is too many to count - <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">H5BP</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>, <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/">320 and up</a>, I could go on. With so many fantastic, freely(!) obtainable code bases, surely a front-end developer's life when setting up and coding a site is made much easier: Download, unzip, and ta-da - you've got a site up and running in no time. Just <strike>add water</strike> customise and you are good to go, right? Erm. No. Not for me.</p>
<h2>Your own code feels most comfortable</h2>

<p>Having worked closely with other developers and looking at different frameworks, it is clear that each developer has his/her have own way of approaching and coding sites. Luckily, there are standards and best practices that help us stay in-line and work with each other, but we all have our preferences and quirks. It's like driving a car: The pedals are for speeding up/slowing down, the steering wheel for changing direction, and the lights to illuminate the way. It's the same for every car, but yet, everybody has her/his own driving style. And that is absolutely fine. If you adhere to the rules of the road, arrive at your destination, and haven't harmed any fellow road users en route, your way of driving is the right way.</p>

<p>So, if you have a usable, accessible site, which is built on well-structured, well-commented, and valid code, then you are coding the right way.</p>

<p>Granted, with some developers your ways of coding just 'gel', and with others it is an uphill struggle and you can end up feeling like <a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/432">this</a>, but it is because of these personal preferences that our own code will always feel most comfortable to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have worked with other developers, you will know what I mean. You can understand another person's code and work with it, but it will never sit quite right. It's like putting on another person's clothes (by now you've realised that I am sucker for an analogy, right?). Or, as <a href="https://twitter.com/stephaniehobson/status/227911304839577600">Stephanie Hobson said</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Frameworks feel like putting on someone else's wet clothes. Baggy and clingy in all the wrong places and I can't get it to hang straight.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Know the purpose of every piece of code on your site</h2>

<p>I do not mean to say that we should ignore frameworks and spent days trying to solve a problem, if a great solution has already been found - the very opposite. I find great inspiration in looking at updates and techniques, particularly in H5BP and Bootstrap. But I can't bring myself to just 'slap it on' and be on my merry coding way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need to be able to understand the existence and purpose of every piece of code, why exactly it is where it is and what it is needed for. My own thought-processes need to be connected to every line to make it truly my own.</p>

<p>Rachel Andrews puts this perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am concerned that these [frameworks] are being promoted as something everyone should include from the outset, rather than being a toolkit you draw on to deal with problems once they have arisen. [...] make sure every bit of code added to your project is there for a reason you can explain, not just because it is part of some standard toolkit or boilerplate.</p>
<cite><a href="http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2012/03/21/stop-solving-problems-you-dont-yet-have/">Stop solving problems you don't yet have</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>And the best way to know your site inside and out is to, firstly, build it yourself, and secondly, to keep it basic enough, so that it easily gives birth to new sites, without inhibiting their full potential and needs.</p>
<h2>I show you mine...</h2>

<p>After all of this, it is needless to say that I have my own <a href="https://github.com/katrinkerber/base">base files</a>. They are not as drastically simple as Rachel's, but they provide a nice, sturdy shell for a new site to move into. Resets remove ugly browser default styles, little CSS helpers cure every-day woes, and some basic typography styles ensure that my plain HTML prototypes don't look like love children from the 1990s.</p>

<p>I constantly update them based on new expericens and know them well enough to quickly remove or edit parts according to every new site's needs. If I come across great techniques and solutions for specific scenarios, I keep them easily accessible. I feel most comfortable that way, and I believe this makes me a better coder, too.</p>

<p>So, go forth, be free, and roll to your own base - your sites, skills and fellow developers will thank you for it.</p>
