<p>Oh, forgive me CSS Lords, for I have tried!</p>

<p>Whilst recently working on a couple of pretty big sites (<a href="http://www.easons.com">Easons</a> and <a href="http://unbiased.co.uk">Unbiased</a> - thanks <a href="http://www.tangentsnowball.com/">Team Tangent</a>), I acquainted myself with writing CSS the LESS way.</p>

<p>Like a good girl, I set up global variables, magical mixins, nested and intended selectors, and broke styles down into seperate files. I worked closely with other developers and it went well. But something just wasn't right. Writing CSS is my most favourite part of developing sites, and yes, I was enjoying it, but for some reason my heart didn't seem to be in it.</p>

<p>Recently I was asked to make some updates to a site I had build a while ago. I opened the stylesheet and the moment I looked at it my heart skipped a beat. There they were: all the declarations together in one file, nicely ordered into sections, but most importantly with repeated selector names, on single lines, and with minimal indentation. My eyes gleamed, my mouth smiled - within an instant I knew exactly what I was looking at, what I needed to do and where to make the amends.Â </p>

<p>This was how I used to write CSS, and I didn't realise how much I missed until then.</p>

<p>By that time I had already started to code this site, but I went into an overhaul frenzy and immediately merged my stylesheets into one and reverted all nested selectors. As I progressed the build I found my way of making the best of what Sass has to offer (I moved on from LESS) - I love variables and mixins, and I like to keep major chunk of fixed component declarations in seperate files to keep the main stylesheet easily scannable. <a href="r/_themes/candy/css/styles.scss">This is what it currently looks like</a>.</p>

<p>I do of course understand the need to code CSS in such a way that it is easy for fellow developers to work with, particularly on big sites, but my heart will always go out to the humble single-file styles written in single lines.</p>

<p>Look at this beauty, for example:</p>

<p><img src="/katrinkerber/assets/img/notes/single-line-css-porn.png" alt="Screenshot of a CSS file written in single lines"></p>

<p>What's not to love?*</p>

<p><small>* this is a rhetorical question, and by no means am I asking anybody to agree - I am too well aware of the can of worms that is single- vs multi-line ;)</small></p>
