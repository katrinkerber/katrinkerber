    heading: Hand-coded
    copy: |
      <p>A set of <a href="https://github.com/katrinkerber/base">base files</a> allow me to start coding productively fast, with basic prototypes being up and running quickly, whilst being minimal enough to be fully extendable and flexible according to a site's specific needs.</p>
      
      <p>Frameworks, such as H5BP or Bootstrap inspire me and are brilliant tool sets, but <a href="/notes/let-there-be-your-own-framework">I don't use them as a base</a>.</p>

    heading: Progressive
    copy: |
      <p>Following the <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933">'mobile first' approach</a>, I plan a site's content, display and interactive functionality with a mobile context in mind and start coding by writing plain HTML first. This ensures a focus on the essentials, and with my <a href="https://github.com/katrinkerber/base/blob/master/css/styles.scss">minimal CSS base file</a>, it creates a nice, solid foundation.<br>

    heading: Semantic and structured
    copy: |
      <p>Well-structured and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/semantic-markup.html">semantic markup</a> makes a site more meaningful for browsers, screen readers, search engines and fellow coders. I love the new HTML5 sectioning elements and I find it strangely satisfying to run a page through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/12/semantic-extractor.html">Semantic Data Extractor</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Where appropriate, I will use also <a href="http://schema.org/">schemas</a>, making it even easier for search engines to understand and categorise the content.</p>
      
      <p>All my sites are at least AA compliant, containing WAI-ARIA roles, alt tags for images, meaningful links, labels related to form fields, and validated HTML.</p>

    heading: Hardboiled
    copy: |
      <p>With a solid foundation in place, bells and whistles can be added for user scenarios that allow it - a large desktop monitor, broadband connection and Chrome as browser, for example.</p>
      
      <p>I apply the latest techniques when they are handled well by modern browsers, without forcing them onto older, less capable ones. This is the <a href="http://hardboiledwebdesign.com">'hardboiled' way</a>, which not only makes a site more exciting, but also <a href="http://boagworld.com/design/where-are-my-rounded-corners/">quicker, future-proof, and maintainable</a>. </p>

    heading: Modular
    copy: |
      <p>Seeing a basic HTML structure come to live by applying CSS is my absolute favourite part of building websites and I couldn't possibly put it any better than <a href="http://cognition.happycog.com/article/more-or-less">Allison Wagner</a>:</p>
      
      <blockquote><p>I love spinning straw into gold, rescuing HTML elements from browser default styles, curving corners, softening colors, and cushioning containers. [...]&nbsp;I see a site’s visual design as one giant puzzle, patiently waiting to be analyzed, broken down into component parts, and built back up again. </p></blockquote>
      
      <p>I structure a site's CSS into resets, layout, typography, modular site components, section and user context specific styles. With this and detailed planning, the "puzzle pieces" can easily fall into place, with the site remaining maintainable and extendable.</p>

    heading: Easy to update
    copy: |
      <p>CMS can be a real party poopers. Wrangling with convoluted markup that invades carefully crafted code, poor control panels, and complex steps for, what should be, simple updates is just frustrating for anyone involved.</p>
      
      <p>My CMS of choice are <a href="http://expressionengine.com">Expression Engine</a> and <a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> - they are flexible and extendable power-houses, which conform and mould to a site’s requirements and are a joy to use.</p>

    heading: Optimised, optimised, optimised
